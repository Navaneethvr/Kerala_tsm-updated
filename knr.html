            <p><span class="first-character ny">A</span> famous pilgrim centre in the North Malabar region of Kerala, Sree Peralassery temple is situated at Peralassery in Kannur. The main deity worshipped here is Lord Subramanya. The temple traces its origin to the Thretha Yuga. As per the Ramayana, Lord Sree Rama along with Lakshmana and Hanuman, on their way to Lanka in search of Sita (consort of Sree Rama), reached this place and felt the presence of Lord Subramanya. On approval from Lord Ayyappa, Sree Rama decided to consecrate the idol of Lord Subramanya in this place. He sent Hanuman to the north to find a suitable idol to be installed. When he failed to come at the right time for consecration, Sree Rama removed his Peruvala [great bangle – a symbol of kingdom] and consecrated it. Hence the place got its name Peruvalassery, which in course of time got contracted to Peralassery. Later Hanuman tried to remove the bangle in order to consecrate the idol, but could not do so as he was warned by a serpent.

              Famous for snake worship, hen’s eggs are the main offerings in the temple. The annual Kodiyettam festival is a key attraction here and usually falls in December. The traditional temple art forms like Thayambaka, Irattathayambaka, Chakyarkoothu, Pattakam Ottan Thullal, and Kathakali are performed in the temple during festival seasons. A visit to the temple during this time will leave you elated and spiritually energized.
              
              The temple pond is a source of wonder for all devotees, and taking a dip is considered sacred. This rectangular pond has an impressive architecture with countless steps leading into the pool from all the four sides. The local belief is that on the day of Thulam Sankramam, water from the Cauvery will reach the well of temple pond. This temple, renowned for its architectural splendour and legends, is a must-visit destination.</p>

The arresting square fort has gigantic walls, massive, intricately carved doors and secret tunnels leading to the sea that make it a delight to explore</p>

            <p><span class="first-character atw">S</span>t Angelos Fort is definitely one of the most popular and frequently visited attractions of Kannur and for more reasons than one. The polished yet prehistoric structure of this fortress oozes with unadulterated elegance and overwhelming power. Standing ashore in the Arabian sea, St Angelos Fort enjoys a panoramic and unobstructed view of the diorama created by the merger of the magnetic waves and the azure waters. It also overlooks the mesmerising Mopilla Bay, a natural harbour.

              St Angelos Fort is mainly famous for the gripping history and the intriguing tales it has to tell. This fort was a point of interest for many dynasties of domestic as well as the international origin and has seen many bitter battles in the quest to conquer it. The Portuguese Viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida had imprisoned his successor, Alfonso de Albuquerque because he did not want to give up the reins of his power. This led to a series of bitter events and conspiracies that have been etched in the history of Portugal as well as Kannur forever. Walking around the walls of this majestic fort, you can almost picture the battles that this fortress has seen. There are tombstones of the soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the fort, barracks and an old chapel here that you can explore. Kannur's first ever lighthouse also stands next to the fort and adds to its already hypnotic glory.</p>

It is one of the most prominent reptile preservation centres in the country and is the only one in Kerala. The Parassinikadavu Snake Park is home to over 150 different species of reptiles like crocodiles, monitor lizards and snakes- both venomous and non-venomous. Not only reptiles and amphibians, but this snake park also goes a long way to preserve and protect many wild mammals, marine creatures as well as rare avifauna- both endemic and migratory.

              The establishment of Parassinikadavu Snake Park was an initiative of the Visha Chikista Kendra, a medical institution that offers diagnosis and treatment of snakebites. The main motto behind establishing this park was to clarify undue superstitions about snakes, educate the common man about these species and create the right awareness among them. Each enclosure of the different species of animals has a brief description of their habitat, moods, peculiarities and interesting titbits that educate the visitors about these exotic and truly extraordinary species. Visiting this park is an absolute treat for the wildlife enthusiasts and animal lovers. You will be stunned by the unique and admirable traits of many of the park's inhabitants and will undoubtedly be left in awe of nature's wondrous creations</p>
