            <p><span class="first-character atw">V</span>ypeen , an island about five km from Ernakulam city, sprawls in an area of more than 25 km. It owes its origin to the heavy floods of 1341.

              Till the advent of the Portuguese in the 16th century, the island was inhabited by a small indigenous fishing community. The Portuguese introduced Catholic faith in the area. They set up many churches including the famous Church of Our Lady of Hope.
              
              The Pallipuram Fort was also built by the Portuguese in this island.
              
              According to recent research, the Portuguese legacy is still visible in the dialect of a few Anglo-Indians in Vypeen. They use the earliest forms of Creole (a mixture of two-three languages) of the Portuguese language but its grammar is influenced by Malayalam.
              
              Under the influence of the Portuguese, Vypeen began to develop and is now one of the islands with the highest density of population. Today, the Goshree bridge connects the island to the city of Kochi  whereas earlier one had to be ferried to and fro. Njarakkal is the business centre of Vypeen.
              
              There are many unexplored spots in the island that are of interest to tourists. The lighthouse at Ochanthuruthu, with its adjacent beach, is one of them.

His famous survey of Travancore in the 1930s led to the formation of this modern day paradise for avian life. He noted that the area was rich in bird diversity and ought to be turned into a sanctuary to conserve the same. The over 300 species that reside in these tropical and deciduous forests are testament to his great vision.

              One can run across the Sri Lankan Frogmouth, Racket Tailed Drongo, Bronzed Drongo, White-bellied Treepie, Shama, Yellow-browed Bulbul, Rufous Babbler, Malabar Parakeet, White-bellied Blue Flycatcher and the Malabar Grey Hornbill in these parts. Beautiful teak, rosewood and mahogany plantations can also be viewed here. It also boasts of over 28 mammal species and over 9 species of reptiles.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character atw">I</span>s there any better place to have a refreshing cup of tea than the hills of Kolukkumalai, which are home to the highest tea plantations in the world? And the tea grown here has a special flavour and freshness, thanks to the high altitude.

              The sprawling plantations and an old tea factory lend an old world charm to this place.  Go on a guided tour through the factory. The two-storied building, built in the 1930s, with its wooden interiors and aroma would present you some time-tested methods of tea processing. Here tea is processed in the traditional method, which is different from the more popular CTC (crush-tear-curl method). Tea lovers will be pleased to sip different varieties of tea from the tea tasting centre here. Those wanting to take home the flavour, can buy fresh packets from the outlet attached to the factory. There are different varieties to choose from like the Broken Orange Pekoe (BOP) and the Flowery Orange Pekoe (FOP). Get some tips from the salesmen on how to extract the different tastes.
              
              Kolukkumalai is about 7,900 ft above sea level and you can have some excellent views of the far off plains in the bordering State of Tamil Nadu. The distant hills slipping in and out of the mist is a captivating sight.      
               
              The rolling acres of tea are an experience in itself for the visitors. Take a lovely stroll on the pathways in the plantations. The more adventurous can take a walk down a fairly steep and narrow bridle path leading to the plains. Only with awe can you hear that this route was once the only option for the estate workers to carry tea chests down and bring provisions to their residence.
              
              Kolukkumalai is about 38 km from Munnar. The hill top is accessible only by jeep and it is about one and a half hour journey from the Munnar town.</p>
