              onni is among the most prominent elephant training centres in Kerala. Located in Pathanamthitta district, it attracts visitors in large numbers throughout the year. One of the major attractions here are the giant wooden cages used to house the elephants. Locally known as Aanakoodu, they can house up to 3 to 4 elephants at a time.
              
              The primary focus of the trainers here is to deal with the development of baby elephants that have been separated from their herd or been found hurt somewhere. The trainers have traditional methods that have been passed down through generations to deal with these situations. The elephants are taught to obey specific commands and are taken for special exercise walks in the morning, are given baths and specific diets.
              
              At Konni, one gets to observe this training procedure in person. The baby elephants love playing with the guests and are especially friendly with children. Bigger elephants are used for rides around the place and are a favourite among all who visit the place</p>

            <p><span class="first-character atw">V</span>isitors to Pathanamthitta district are never really sure of what to expect from Aranmula. This is mostly due to the lore surrounding this exotic village, famous for the genius of its craftsmen and the ancient vibe one experiences the moment oneenters. Aranmula is famous for its Aranmula Kannadi (metal mirrors), the centuries’ old Sree Krishna Temple, the unique ritualistic feast of `Vallasadya,’ and famed Aranmula Boat Race and the list goes on.

              It gets its name from the centuries-old Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple (dedicated to Sree Krishna) on the banks of the holy River Pamba, a virtual hotbed of devotees. The murals, carvings and paintings here have inspired much awe and interest. It is also the venue for the Aranmula Vallasadya, a ritual offering to the deity Lord Parthasarathy in which the oarsmen of the snake boats are offered a feast. With over 70 dishes it is probably one of the largest vegetarian feasts in India. (Watch the video of Vallasadya)
              
              Its legendary Vijnana Kalavedi houses some of the finest classes and teachers for a variety of art forms like Kathakali, classical dances, classical music and Kalaripayattu. Visitors can stay here for an extended period and observe the ancient crafts being passed on diligently to the next generation. 
              
              A trip is never complete without obtaining one of its special metal mirrors- the beautiful Aranmula Kannadi. From being gorgeous souvenirs to exquisite wedding gifts, these are unique to this locale and haven't yet been replicated anywhere else in the world. </p>

            <p><span class="first-character atw">L</span>ocated around 13 km from Adoor, Mannadi village in Pathanamthitta district has a significant place in India’s freedom struggle against the British. It was here that Veluthampi Dalawa, the Prime Minister of erstwhile Travancore kingdom who revolted against the British East India Company’s supremacy in India, spent his last days. He committed suicide at Mannadi Pazhayakavu Devi Temple to avoid capture by the British.

              The place now houses a cultural complex built in memory of Veluthampi Dalawa. The complex houses a pavilion with the statue of Dalawa, a museum displaying copies of historical documents (including the famed Kundara declaration) and an open-air theatre.
              
              Set up by the Department of Archaeology, the museum gives a glimpse of the heroics of Dalawa and the culture of ancient Travancore. It also has an open-air gallery which includes portraits of all the Travancore rulers from Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma to Sree Chithra Thirunal. The museum also has several artefacts such as the stone statue of Buddha, ancient agriculture utensils, cannons and ancient war equipment. A picture gallery depicting the life of Veluthampi Dalawa and a numismatics gallery are also there.
              
              A shrine of Lord Shiva, said to have been destroyed by the British, is also seen in the compound. There is a beautiful garden and a library on the museum premises.
              
              Mavara Para, Karingalichal sightseeing spot, Adayappad Waterfall, Ayiravalli Para and Munroe Island are the nearby tourist places.</p>
