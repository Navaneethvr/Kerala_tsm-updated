Here is one such national park in the high ranges of Kerala which offers the magnificent view of hills with tea plantations - the Eravikulam National Park. Situated in the Kannan Devan Hills of the southern Western Ghats, the wildlife park with an area of 97 sq. km. can be reached via Munnar. Located in the Devikulam Taluk of Idukki district in Kerala, after reaching Munnar, you need to take the road going to Rajamala to reach this national park.

Visitors are allowed only to the tourism area that is in Rajamala, the region lying beyond the road entry into Eravikulam.
