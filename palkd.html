The gateway to Kerala from the north, a 40 kilometre break in the mountains known as the Palakkad Gap gives access to this land situated at the foot of the Western Ghats. The pass acts as a corridor between Kerala and the neighbouring Tamil Nadu and played a key role in the trade relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular India. Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest), this place was once a stunning expanse of forest covered with the sweet-scented flowers of the Pala tree. A potpourri of Tamil and Kerala culture, some of the finest Carnatic musicians hail from this district which continues to be a principally agrarian society.</p>

The entire garden is made from broken pieces of bangles, tiles, used plastic cans, tins and other waste materials. Also situated in the gardens is the massive Malampuzha Yakshi (female vampire) built in 1969 by Kanayi Kunhiraman, a greatly respected sculptor from the state. It is a spectacular relic of art that we are lucky to still have with us. The flowering beds, fountains and rose gardens along with an aerial ropeway make it a place that instantly soothes your soul.

              In the lower hills of the Western Ghats lies the beautiful Malampuzha township whose lush greenery and plethora of picnic spots make it a must-visit spot in these areas. It has really good trekking trails that are available to all with a penchant for the same. Malampuzha Gardens and the Irrigation Dam tend to be the areas that attract the highest number of visitors. Apart from being perfect picnic spots, there is a host of interesting trivia surrounding the place that adds to its appeal.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character atw">F</span>rom the town of Nenmara in Palakkad district, the cloud-caressed peaks of the majestic Nelliyampathy Hill ranges are a sight to behold. The height of the hills ranges from 467 m to 1,572 m and it has an extremely calming effect on all who view it. To reach Nelliyampathy, one has to take the road starting from Nenmara that proceeds to the Pothundy Dam. There are about 10 hairpin bends that have to be negotiated on the way to Nelliyampathy.

              The Pothundy Dam is a beautiful locale with facilities for boating and is a nice option as a picnic place. As the Ghat road winds its way up to Nelliyampathy, at certain places there are viewpoints from where the vast stretches of Palakkad district are visible with its extensive paddy fields forming a verdant carpet. It also offers a splendid view of the Palakkad Gap, which is a geographical phenomenon in the Western Ghats formation in this region, bringing into view, parts of the adjoining State of Tamil Nadu.
              
              On the way up, those interested in bio farming can take a close look at the privately managed farms and also vast expanses of tea estates managed by different plantation companies. The hills of Nelliyampathy are also well known for their orange cultivation.
              
              Privately owned hotels and resorts are located at various points, as one goes up the hills of Nelliyampathy. The bio-farms located here are a major landmark as one proceeds up before reaching the topmost point at Palagapandi Estate. The estate has a quaint bungalow, built during the British rule in India, and has now been converted into a privately owned resort. At Kaikatty, a community hall is available, which is usually used as a base by those interested in trekking.
              
              Not far away from Palagapandy is Seetharkundu where one can have a fantastic view of the valley and a 100-m high waterfall providing an added attraction. From Palagapandy, one can trek or go by jeep to reach Mampara — another breathtaking vantage point at Nelliyampathy. The area in and around Palagapandy Estate has tea, cardamom and coffee plantations with adjoining hills allowing one to catch a glimpse of the wildlife in the form of Indian Gaur, elephants, leopards, Giant Squirrel etc. and is also a paradise for birdwatchers. </p>

          <div class="block">
            <p><span class="first-character atw">T</span>he first heritage village in the state, Kalpathy in Palakkad district is famous for its unique architecture, culture and Rathotsavam (chariot festival). The traditional hamlet on the banks of River Kalpathy was established by migrant Brahmins from Thanjavur. 

              There are mainly four agraharams in Kalpathy: Chathapuram, Govindarajapuram, Old Kalpathy and New Kalpathy. Even if the nearby places have changed, the cultural heritage of the village has been preserved as such over the years. 
              
              There is a Siva temple here that resembles the famous Kasi Viswanatha Swamy temple of Benares. Sree Viswanatha Swamy Temple at Kalpathy is one of the oldest Siva temples in Malabar, and is believed to be over 700 years old. 
              
              The annual Ratholsavam or chariot festival at Sree Viswanatha Swamy Temple is one of the most spectacular festivals of Kerala. It is based on Vedic Tamil Brahmin culture. A week-long Carnatic music festival is organized as part of this. 
              
              During the last three days of the festival, the deities from the temple are taken out and installed in the chariot. There are three chariots: one for the main deity Sree Viswanatha Swamy and the goddess Parvati, the second for Visweshwara and third for Lord Subrahmanya Swamy.  
              
              These giant chariots are the cynosure of all the eyes during the festival. Festooned with flowers, mirror work, trinkets and other decorative objects, these temple chariots are a sight to behold. The devotees team up to lug these chariots through the narrow streets of the heritage village of Kalpathy.
              
              The final day sees decked-up chariots from nearby temples in the villages of New Kalpathy, Old Kalpathy and Chathapuram also joining the festival. This rare meeting of the temple chariots is called Devaratha Sangamom, meaning “meeting of the Lords,” and is one of the much-awaited events of the festival. All the six temple chariots bearing the deities are then brought to Sree Vishwanatha Swamy Temple.</p>

        <section>
          <div class="block">
            <p><span class="first-character atw">T</span>he area was declared a Tiger Reserve during 2010 at a total extent of 643.66 sq km, out of which an extent of 390.89 km2 has been declared as the core or critical tiger habitat and 252.77 km2 as the buffer zone of the Tiger Reserve.

              Parambikulam is a well-protected part of the Nelliampathy - Anamalai sub unit of the Western Ghats and is buffered by ecologically similar forests of other Forest Divisions and Protected Areas of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
              
              The Reserve supports diverse habitat types viz., evergreen forests, moist and dry deciduous forests and grasslands. Other unique habitats like montane grasslands and marshy grasslands (locally known as ‘vayals’) are extensively found.
              
              Considerable extent of man-made teak plantations and the deep freshwater ecosystem (Reservoirs) created by the construction of three dams during the 60s add to the diversity. The Reserve supports healthy population of several endangered fauna and the presence of tigers and other co-predators in the landscape emphasizes the ecological importance of this region. Most of the herbivore species of the Western Ghats such as the Asian elephant, Gaur, Spotted deer, Sambar and Barking deer (Muntjac) are found here.
              
              Parambikulam has one of the highest densities of Gaur population in Southern India. The only South Indian wild goat, the Nilgiri Tahr is also found on the high-altitude rocky hills and grasslands in the Tiger Reserve.
              
              Healthy populations of about 250 to 300 Lion-tailed macaques among other primates are found here. Rodents like Malabar giant squirrel and Flying squirrel are among the important arboreal animals. Significant population of resident and migratory avifauna of about 273 species makes the Reserve a bird watcher’s paradise. Among the aquatic fauna, crocodiles, otters, freshwater fish, especially Mahseer (an endemic game fish) are worth mentioning. The Reserve is also home to several rare small animals like Tarantula (large bodied spiders).
              
              The floral diversity of the Reserve is extraordinary for lack of a better word. As per a recent report of Kerala Forest Research Institute, the Tiger Reserve supports an estimated 1400 species of Angiosperms. So far 1,320 species of flowering plants belonging to 680 genera and 133 families have been identified including about 70 species of orchids. The inventory continues to expand every year. This magnitude of floral richness is due to the mosaic pattern of vegetation in the Reserve. Kariyanshola, which is a part of Sungam Range of the Tiger Reserve has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its immeasurable ecological value to the world.</p>

            <p><span class="first-character atw">T</span>he hills of Rayiranellur near Pattambi, Palakkad is an enigma to any traveller. At Rayiranellur Mala, a 500 m hill, myth meets history. Shrouded in mysticism, this is where Parayipetta Panthirukulam, the legendary folklore of Kerala comes alive.

              Kerala is known for its vibrant folklores, and at this hill, one gets to experience an otherworldly story from the distant past. The hill celebrates the legend of Naranath Bhranthan and to honour this mythical character, a magnificent statue has been created and installed. 
              
              Legend has it that Naranath Bhranthan was one among the 12 offspring of Vararuchi, the astrologer in the court of King Vikramaditya. Naranath Bhranthan would roll huge boulders to the crest of the hill only to push them down the other side and then clap in joyous abandon. One day, Goddess Durga appeared before him and blessed him. The incident is believed to have happened on the first day of the Malayalam month of Thulam [October-November]. And till date, people climb the hill during this day, as a mark of respect to the legendary figure.
              
              The hill can be climbed with ease as a flight of steps leads one to its crest. Revered by devotees, this hill sees hundreds of people offering worship during the pilgrimage season. The peak of the hill offers a magnificent view of the surrounding areas. This place exudes an ineffable aura of magic and mysticism. It is reason enough to come here and experience the beauty of solitude. </p>
