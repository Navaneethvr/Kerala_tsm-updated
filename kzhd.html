Vasco Da Gama first set foot here in 1498 after which it became one of the most important ports in the Malabar region for the trade of spices, silk and other goods between European countries and India. The nature of land in Kozhikode is marshy. That is the reason why the world also knows Kozhikode as Chullikkad, which means a ‘shrubby jungle’. The friendly nature of the people of Kozhikode, along with their love for traditional values is heart touching.

              Erstwhile Malabar District of British India became a part of the newly formed Kerala on November 1 1956 and a new revenue district named Kozhikode was formed on January 1, 1957. Kozhikode is known to the world as the Center of Malabar, the land of spices and festivals. It attracts traders from all over the globe with its magnificent spices and other commodities. Kozhikode attained a position of pre-eminence in the trade of pepper and other spices since 13th century which made it an ‘Indian Emporium’ of International trade. From time immemorial, the city has been attracting travelers. Its charming physical features and the prosperity is what makes it stand out way above any other city. The economy of Kozhikode mainly depends on agriculture and fisheries but it is not just limited to them. The timber industry is very powerful in Kozhikode and it is also the main center for the export of tea, coffee and coconuts..</p>

The Pazhassi Raja Museum & Art Gallery adjacent to the museum displays the acclaimed paintings of Kerala's cherished artists, Raja Ravi Varma (1848 - 1906) whose works brought international repute to the State and his uncle Raja Raja Varma.

              The museum is managed by the State Archaeology Department and has on display mural paintings, antique bronzes, ancient coins, models of temples, umbrella stones, dolmenoid cists (quadrangular burial chambers with capstones), and similar megalithic monuments.
              
              The museum and the art gallery are named after the great Pazhassi Raja, born Kerala Varma of the Padinjare Kovilakom of the Kottayam Royal Family. The famous 'Pazhassi Revolt' (against the British East India Company during the second half of the 1700s) was led by Pazhassi Raja. Nicknamed the Lion of Kerala, Pazhassi Raja is also credited with introducing guerrilla warfare in the hills of Wayanad to resist the increasingly intolerable British colonialism. This great freedom fighter was shot dead in an encounter on 30 November 1805..</p>
