            <p><span class="first-character ny">S</span>ree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is a centuries-old temple in Thiruvananthapuram dedicated to Lord Vishnu. It is a must-visit spiritual tourist destination for travelers in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala. The eye-catching architecture is the prime attraction of this temple. The temple architecture has the right blend of both Kerala and Dravidian styles. Being one of the sacred 108 Vishnu temples in the country, many Hindu devotees visit this holy place every day. Lord Vishnu, the presiding deity in this temple is in the form of reclining on Anantha, the large hooded serpent.

              Marthanda Varma, a famous Travancore King dedicated his kingdom to Lord Padmanabha. Even he vowed that the royal family rules their kingdom on behalf of Lord Padmanabha. The descendants served the kingdom as the servants of the Lord. Marthanda Varma Maharaja did great renovation to this temple and made it one of the beautiful present day structure. The king also introduced two major festivals, the Murajapam and Bhadra Deepam to the temple. In the local language, Murajapam means, the continuous chanting of prayers and the temple conducts this festival once in six years. The capital city, Thiruvananthapuram got its name from the main deity, Sree Ananada Padmanabhaswamy.
              
              Some of the ancient texts like Skanda Purana and Padma Purana have references about the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple. The sanctum sanctorum of the temple is placed on a stone slab. The main idol is nearly 18 feet long and devotees can see it through three different doors. The exquisite work in bronze and stone made the architecture of this temple marvelous. The beautiful murals and paintings adorn the interiors of Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple. Covered with gold-plated copper sheets, the flag post is a great feature of the temple which is nearly 80 feet high. Bali Peeda Mandapam and Mukha Mandapam are two halls in the temple with attractive structural features. Fascinating sculptures of different Hindu deities decorate these halls.
              
              Visitors need to follow strict dress code in order to enter the temple. Men need to wear the traditional mundu or dhoti around the waist without any shirt. Women need to wear sari, half-sari and skirt and blouse to enter the temple. Nowadays, temple authorities permit visitors to enter the temple wearing dhotis over their churidar or pants. Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple is nearly 1 kilometer away from Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station. Trivandrum International Airport is only 6 kilometers from this temple.

            <p><span class="first-character atw">P</span>onmudi is a breathtaking hill station situated at the southern stretch of Western Ghats. Located within a short driving distance from Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, Ponmudi literally means The Golden Peak.

              The first thing that travellers to Ponmudi notice is the thick tropical forests that carpets the foot of the hill range. Hairpin bends, steep climb and mist covered stretches marks the route to Ponmudi from Kallar, located at the base of the village.
              
              Located close to Agasthyar Hills, one of the biggest peaks in Western Ghats, Ponmudi offers excellent trekking and camping opportunities. Trekking through the thick forests one gets to see assortment of mountain flowers, unusual butterflies and small rivulets. However, the incline is steep and the trek rigorous.
              
              For those who prefer casual strolls instead of trekking, Ponmudi would leave them impressed. A walk through the tea gardens is a feast for the eye and the senses.
              
              Ponmudi is primarily divided into the Upper and the Lower Sanatorium. Kerala government has started an ecotourism project in the Upper Sanatorium area to promote tourism.
              
              Plenty of birds, both native and migratory, have made hills of Ponmudi their home. The Ponmudi Hills are also a natural habitat for Nilgiri Tahr. Though they number around a couple of hundreds, it still forms an important habitat for the endangered species.
              
              Sightseeing in and around Ponmudi includes Ponmudi Waterfalls, the Deer Park, River Kallar, Meenmutty Falls and Peppara Wildlife Sanctuary among others. Apart from sightseeing, Ponmudi is also famous for Ayurvedic medical treatments.</p>

              A two thousand-year-old shrine the Janardhanaswamy Temple stands on the cliffs overlooking the beach, a short distance away. The Sivagiri Mutt, founded by the great religious reformer and philosopher Sree Narayana Guru (1856 - 1928) is also close by. The Samadhi (the final resting place) of the Guru here attracts thousands of devotees every year during the Sivagiri Pilgrimage days - 30th December to 1st January. Sree Narayana Guru propagated the ideology: "one caste, one religion and one God", in a society torn by the taboos of caste system.
              
              Varkala offers excellent accommodation facilities for tourists and is fast becoming a popular health resort with many Ayurvedic massage centres.</p>
