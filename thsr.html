The palace, built in the Dutch and Kerala style of architecture belongs to the few structures of this kind in Kerala. The main structure of the palace has a two-storeyed building and a traditional Kerala style Naalukettu. The interiors of the palace, because of its unique construction offer comfortable and pleasant staying conditions irrespective of the prevailing weather conditions.

              The final resting place of Shakthan Thampuran is also located inside the palace, besides that of a Zamorin and a ruler of Kochi. The palace also has a very ancient Sarpakaavu or Serpent Grove, which is a place for worshipping the serpents according to Hindu belief, and was once widely practiced in Kerala.
